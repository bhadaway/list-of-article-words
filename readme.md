# List of Article/Minor/Short Words That Should Be Lowercase When Using Title Case

Find the raw list here:

The AP/APA style guide is very good concerning title case:

https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case

However, my list is slightly more opinionated. Also, the following words are not included in the list, but I sometimes struggle with them because they can often look goofy both in capitalized or non-capitalized form, depending on the context:

are
be
do
has
into
then
this
was
when
